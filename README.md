TODO

* Move typedefs to separate file (client)
* Drop usage of Map and Coordinates in client
* Random userID's that work with COLORS properly

* Smoother animation
* Client should turn immediately instead of waiting for the server state
* Zoom in more on map
* Use google snake game as inspiration
    - show digesting food
    - linear movement
    - pop-up blocks that have collision
* Move CSS to file isntead of having it pollute js

IDEAS

* 2+ players controlling the same snake
* Item that lets snake expand like tail is always an apple
* Easy to create mechanics (e.g. drunk -> filter: blur(10px))
